# Pharmaceutical Supply Chain Tracker

## Project Description

The Pharmaceutical Supply Chain Tracker is a blockchain-based solution designed to ensure medication authenticity by tracking drugs from manufacturer to pharmacy, preventing counterfeit medicines. This smart contract leverages the Stellar blockchain using Soroban SDK to create an immutable, transparent record of each medication's journey through the supply chain.

By registering medications at the point of manufacture and tracking every custody transfer, this system provides pharmacies, healthcare providers, and patients with the ability to verify the authenticity of medications, significantly reducing the risk of counterfeit drugs entering the healthcare system.

## Project Vision

Our vision is to create a safer, more transparent pharmaceutical ecosystem where:

- **Every medication is traceable** from manufacturer to end consumer
- **Counterfeit drugs are eliminated** through blockchain-verified authenticity
- **Patient safety is enhanced** by ensuring only genuine medications reach healthcare facilities
- **Supply chain transparency** builds trust among manufacturers, distributors, pharmacies, and patients
- **Regulatory compliance** is simplified through immutable audit trails

We envision a future where blockchain technology becomes the standard for pharmaceutical supply chain management, protecting millions of lives from the dangers of counterfeit medications.

## Key Features

### 1. **Medication Registration**
- Manufacturers can register new medications with unique identifiers
- Each medication receives a blockchain-verified batch number
- Timestamp recording for manufacturing date
- Immutable record creation preventing data tampering

### 2. **Custody Transfer Tracking**
- Real-time tracking of medication movement through the supply chain
- Authorization-required transfers ensuring only legitimate handlers can update custody
- Status updates at each stage (manufactured, in transit, delivered)
- Complete chain of custody from manufacturer to pharmacy

### 3. **Authenticity Verification**
- Instant verification of medication authenticity using medication ID
- Blockchain-based validation preventing counterfeit detection bypass
- Public verification accessible to pharmacies and healthcare providers
- Binary verification system (verified/not verified) for clear determination

### 4. **Transparent Data Retrieval**
- Complete medication information accessible on-chain
- View manufacturer details, batch numbers, and current handler
- Track medication status throughout its lifecycle
- Historical data preservation for audit and compliance purposes

### 5. **Decentralized & Secure**
- Built on Stellar blockchain using Soroban smart contracts
- No single point of failure or data manipulation
- Cryptographic security ensuring data integrity
- Permissioned access control for different stakeholders

## Future Scope
